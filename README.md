I'm Enrico, a computer programming student on a mission to create captivating digital experiences. My journey into the world of coding began about 3 years ago when I made a career changing decision and decided to go back to school. Since then, I've been exploring various forms of software development, with a particular passion for web development, application development.

🌐 **Web Development:** I love making beautiful and user-friendly websites. You can find some of my web projects in my repositories.

📱 **Application Development:** I enjoy building applications that solve real-world problems. Whether it's a mobile app or a desktop application, I'm always up for the challenge of making software that makes life easier.

🎮 **Game Development:** Game development is my creative outlet. I've dabbled in Unity and C# to create fun and interactive games. Check out my game projects to see some of my work.

🔍 **Learning and Growing:** As a student, I'm constantly learning and expanding my skills. I believe that technology has the power to shape our world in a positive way, and I'm excited to be a part of it.
